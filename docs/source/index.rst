Documentation about Bah! No more primitive types!
=================================================


Bah! It is just a little set of simple PHP classes to play with **strings**, **numbers**, **characters**, **arrays** and **hashes**. The aim is not to replace PHP primary type equivalent: it is only a set of usefull common actions group together.

Each class is designed to be used in many different ways, using **magic getters**, **magic setters**, or **methods**.

When it is possible, **chaining methods** (and then **magic getters** too) are available.
